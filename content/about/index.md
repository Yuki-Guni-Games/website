# About
We are a fresh new indie game studio located in Gothenburg, Sweden, founded by veterans with a decade+ of experience in the industry. As of right now we have our focus set on helping others with porting and co-dev. While we specialize in Unity, we have worked across multiple engines, languages, and platforms. This includes consoles, mobile, VR, and even a little bit of SNES and C64.

Here is an assortment of titles we have worked on previously:
- Earthion (Steam, Switch, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X)
- Songs of Conquest (Steam/GOG/EGS, Steam Deck, PS5, Xbox Series S|X, Switch)
- Wavetale (Google Stadia)
- Ghost Giant (PSVR)
- Carly and the Reaperman (Oculus Quest + adding online multiplayer)
- Flipping Death (Steam, Switch, PS4, Xbox One)
- Zombie Vikings (Steam, PS4, Wii U [Unreleased])
- Stick It To The Man! (PS3, PS Vita, Wii U, PS4, iOS [Unreleased])
- SteamWorld Heist (3DS)
- SteamWorld Dig (Wii U)
