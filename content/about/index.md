Yuki Guni Games is a fresh new indie game studio located in Gothenburg, Sweden, founded by veterans with a decade+ of experience in the industry. While we have our eyes set on growing the studio and developing creative and innovative games of our own, currently our focus lies on helping others with porting and co-dev. Although we specialize in Unity, our accumulated experience spans multiple engines, languages, and platforms (consoles, mobile, VR, and even a little bit of SNES).

Here is an assortment of titles we have worked on previously:
